# KRUSKAL-PRIM


This code implements graph class and performs Kruskal and Prim minimum spanning tree algorithm to calculate the MST.
This is a continuation of my Dijstra algorithm.

vertex: node in a graph represented by an integer.

Edge: edge of a graph.

Tree: implements tree as a class to save Minimum spanning tree. 

closed set: set of graph vertices to whom minimum path is already found.

open set: set of graph vertices that can be reached form already traversed graph. They are arranged in the assending order of cost.

operator.cpp : contains the operator overloading for vertices and edges.

auxilary.cpp : contains the implementation of Kruskal and prim.

Feel free to use it as you like.
Would love to hear any thoughts and feedbacks
